# Compiiile

> Compiiile is the most convenient way to render a folder containing markdown files. Previewing and searching markdown files has never been that easy (it's really just a command away !) :sparkles:

## Purpose

I document everything in markdown and have always been frustrated not having a simple tool to just **preview** a whole
folder, being able to **search** through it, make **slides** out of it, and get a **production-ready** build of all the files as a knowledge base. On
top of that, finding a tool with a sweet and simple UI is not that easy.

That's what Compiiile does. And it does it hassle-free !

## Features

- [x]  üì¶  **No config required, everything just works out of the box, without changing your files** (resolves images and relative links (cross-references), print-ready rendering)
- [x]  üå± Available everywhere with static files deployment: just host it somewhere and access it in any browser on your computer, phone or whatever you are using
- [x] :link: Quick access to your files via the navbar and links to the previous and next file (with table of content generation)
- [x] :tv: Display some files as slides
- [x] :mag: **Full-text quick search with content preview**
- [x] :bulb: Can serve as knowledge base
- [x] :wrench: Customizable by env variables or config file, it's up to you
- [x] :star2: You get it, it simply does the job, period.

### What Compiiile isn't

- It's not a markdown editor, there are already plenty available, just choose the one that works best for you, even the simplest text editor will do.
- It's not like VuePress, VitePress, Docusaurus or Notion. Compiiile's goal is to stay simple and stupidly easy without any configuration.

> The goal is to help people rely purely on a **language** (*markdown*), not on *any* platform.

## Installation

You can install Compiiile either globally or per-project:

### Globally

Open a terminal and type one of these commands, whether using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) depending on which package manager you are using:

```bash
yarn global add compiiile # install globally with yarn
# or
npm install -g compiiile # install globally with npm
```

### Per-project

Open a terminal inside the folder containing your markdown files. Then, add Compiiile as a local command using yarn or npm:

```bash
yarn add compiiile # install as a project dependency with yarn
# or
npm install compiiile # install as a project dependency with npm
```

## Quick start

To make yourself an idea and quickly get started using Compiiile, here are some commands that you can run in your terminal to get Compiiile running with a couple of markdown files as tests:

```bash
mkdir test-compiiile && cd test-compiiile # creating a new folder and go into this folder
yarn global add compiiile # installing compiiile as global dependency using yarn
echo '# Test Compiiile\n\n> Here is a blockquote for you\n\n## Your markdown awaits below' > README.md # a first test file
echo '---\nasSlides: true\n---\n\n# Slide 1\n\n---\n\n# And this is slide 2' > slides.md # a second test file as slides
compiiile --title="üìö Compiiile" # running Compiiile for these 2 files
```

Et voil√†, you should be able to preview your files in your browser :tada:.

## Usage

Once installed, 3 commands are available to see your beautiful markdown files :eyes::

- `compiiile dev` : creates a web server to check your markdown files (alias to only `compiiile`)
- `compiiile build` : builds all the files for you to serve them production-ready
- `compiiile preview` : preview your production-ready build

You can run the command you want in your terminal while being in the desired folder.

To use these commands inside a javascript project, you just have to add these commands to the `scripts` section of your
`package.json` file like so:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "compiiile dev",
    "build": "compiiile build",
    "preview": "compiiile preview"
  }
}
```

You can run these scripts by running `yarn <script>` or `npm run <script>` in your terminal (replacing `<script>`
with your script name).

The build command builds your files in a `.compiiile/dist` folder at the root of your current directory by default.
You can override this parameter (see below on how to use a custom configuration).

## Write some markdown (Compiiile-specific parameters)

The goal of this project is to get it running **without changing any markdown files already written**.
Yet, there are some things to consider to configure some files:

### Slides

To make a file usable as slides, you only have to add this parameter to the `frontmatter` of your markdown
file:

```md
---
asSlides: true
---

```

If you are not acquainted with frontmatter, it's just some file-specific parameters that you can put at the very
beginning of your file to be processed (make sure to separate frontmatter values from your content with an empty line after the last `---`).

By adding the frontmatter parameter, the page will directly open up as slides.

To separate your slides, just separate the content of your markdown with:

```md

---

```

> There must be an empty line before and after the `---`

Other frontmatter keys will be handled:

- `title`: set the title to be displayed in the navbar and for SEO
- `description`: set the description for SEO

### Routing

The home page of Compiiile (`/`) points to a `README.md` file located at the root of your folder.

## Custom configuration

Here is the list of parameters that you can set to customize Compiiile (none are required):

| Parameter     | Type    | Description                                                                                       |
|---------------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `title`       | `string` | The title to display on the top-left of the User Interface                                        |
| `description` | `string` | The description that is rendered by default for the SEO                                           |
| `logo`        | `string` | The relative path of the logo to display in the TopBar and as favicon                             |
| `dest`        | `string` | The folder in which to build files, defaults to `./.compiiile/dist`                               |
| `siteUrl`        | `string` | The url of the website in production (without trailing slash), used for the SEO tag `og:image` |

You can use these parameters in 2 ways:

### Script arguments

Config parameters can be passed by script arguments.

For example, if you want to change the title, just run Compiiile like so:

```bash
compiiile dev --title="My knowledge base üìö"
```

### Config file

Another way to set default config parameters is to set them in a dedicated file named `compiiile.config.js` in the
root of your folder.

This should export an object, like in this example that shows common use cases :

```js
module.exports = {
    title: "Compiiile",
    logo: "./my-logo.png",
    dest: "my-custom-build-folder"
}
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è You should bear in mind that script arguments have priority over config file parameters.
